# 100 Days of Code

Welcome to the 100 Days of Code project! This project is designed to help you track your progress as you embark on a coding journey. It features a simple yet effective way to mark off days and keep track of your coding activities.

## Features

- **Interactive Cards**: Each day is represented by a card with a number from 0 to 99.
- **Tick Off Days**: Click on a card to mark it as "ticked off", indicating that you've completed your coding activities for that day.
- **Progress Tracking**: Your progress is saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so you can see your progress even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with a focus on functionality and ease of use.
